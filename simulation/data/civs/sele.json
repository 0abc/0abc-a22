He then turned his attention to mother Greece, attempting to fulfill the dreams of his fathers by invading Greece under the pretext of liberation. The Achaean League and the Kingdom of Pergamon banded together with the Romans to defeat him at the Battle of Magnesia, forever burying the dream of reuniting Alexander's empire."
